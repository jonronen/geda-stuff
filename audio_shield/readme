This project is an Arduino DUE shield for the NXP UDA-1345 audio codec.

It contains two 3.5mm stereo jacks, one for audio-in and one for audio-out.
Five jumpers for MP1-MP5 determine the configuration (sample rate, etc.)

The board is designed for the UDA-1345 chip to operate in
static pin mode (not L3 mode).
This means that MC1 and MC2 are connected to VDDD.

One jumper determines the clock. It can either be a 12.288MHz crystal
on-board chip or an Arduino-based clock.
If the on-board chip is used, set the sample rate to 48KHz and the
MP3 pin low (connect to ground, marked as "-" in the MP1-MP5 header)

Data in and out are streamed through the following Arduino pins:
* pin 24 - Audio Data In (DATAI)
* pin 26 - Audio Data Out (DATAO)
* pin 28 - Left/Right Select (WS)
* pin 30 - Data Clock (BCK)

Power supply should be 3.3V but can be any value between 2.4V and 3.6V.
Supply current should be less than 50mA, so the Arduino 3.3V pin should
be enough for that matter.


TODOs:
* Add an on-board guitar pre-amp with a guitar input jack for audio-in.
* Add an on-board mic pre-amp with a microphone jack for audio-in.
* Add some knobs and switches for multi-purpose effects, to be connected
  to the Arduino's ADC and/or GPIO.
* Write some Arduino code to work with this shit!
